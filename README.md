# Twitter_Data_Sentiment_Analysis_Stock_Prediction
We have used Sandbox API using twitter developer account for data extraction on Narendra modi from twitter.
We have used Python for sentiment analysis of the tweets and have classified all the tweets as positive, negative or neutral and have aggregated
using date to come up with a number for sentiments daywise.
Now we took data from NIFTY- FIFTY for for closing values of stocks and have tried the sentiment numbers daywise against the change in closing price
daywise using linear regression.

The idea is to create a metric of fluctuations of stock markets using sentiments of Organizations, politics etc . It can capture variation of 
systematic risk( beta) of stocks to an extent provided we have enough data.
